# Curated Resources for Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## About this project

This repository contains curated resources on the topic of **Domain Driven Design** (DDD) and **Event Storming** that we recommend internally at SAP and love to share with the community.

Besides providing a collection of great resources we also tried to structure the learning path from a first introduction to deep dives and content specializing on certain aspects. Where we think it adds value, we are giving some hints how to work with the material and what to keep in mind.

Having said that, enjoy the ride ü§†.

## Requirements

There are no prerequisites needed.

## ü§∑ What is DDD all about?

DDD is fundamentally hard to explain in 10 minutes.
At its core, DDD says that your problem/business *domain* is what should first and foremost *drive* the *design* of your software system.
Technology comes later.
DDD offers principles, patterns and tools that help you *collaboratively* explore your domain, develop a common understanding and express this common understanding in useful models.
Last but not least it provides guidance on how to express these models in code, architecture and organization.

You can find a bit more extensive but still brief description of what DDD is about [here](https://www.dddcommunity.org/learning-ddd/what_is_ddd/).

Note: In DDD, people often distinguish between *strategic design* and *tactical design*.
Broadly speaking, strategic design is about understanding the problem domain and splitting it into so-called *bounded contexts* (think of them as modules for now ‚Äì separate things with a distinct boundary between them), while tactical design is about modelling bounded contexts in more detail and diving into actual implementation details.
While both are important and together form a holistic design toolkit, we believe strategic design to be the better starting point for newcomers.
Strategic design has many touch points with other important aspects of software development, such as architecture and organization ‚Äì which is exactly what makes it so valuable.
It's also the pool to draw techniques and principles from when being tasked with understanding a new problem domain.

That being said, there's no wrong way to approach DDD.
We hope that this gives you the ability to better judge which resource is helpful for you at the moment.

## üßë‚Äçüéì DDD & Event Storming 101 - Let's get things started

Not yet sure what DDD and Event Storming is all about and you want to get an overview on the topic?
We got you covered.
In this section we some material that should hook you up on the topic and at the same time give you a good explanation and overview.
This is a perfect starting point for your DDD journey.
From there you can dive deeper into DDD and investigate more detailed on the topics that are of specific interest to you.

> üßë‚Äçüíª *Recommendation* Although you can specialize on aspects of DDD we recommend to approach DDD with a broader perspective and not to hyper-focus on just one aspect.

## Courses

Of course there are also dedicated courses and learning paths available. They are usually paid offerings (maybe your company has a subscription) and go into the details quite quickly. They therefore are recommendations especially for more advanced learners who want to broaden and deepen their knowledge:

## DDD Kata

We believe DDD is something that you must practice yourself to properly understand.
If you want to try out DDD in your team, we came up with a [DDD Kata](ddd-kata.md) that allows you to get hands-on experience.
Give it a shot!
