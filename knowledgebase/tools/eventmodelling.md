# Event Modeling

Event Modeling is a modern methodology for designing information systems by explicitly modeling how information changes over time. It provides a blueprint for systems that helps bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders. In this article, we delve into the principles, building blocks, practical applications, and resources for mastering Event Modeling.

## **1. Introduction**

### What is Event Modeling?

Event Modeling is a collaborative approach to software design that focuses on illustrating how data evolves over time through a sequence of events. This methodology was pioneered by Adam Dymitruk and his team at Adaptech Group to address the challenges of designing complex systems in a structured yet flexible manner.

Unlike other methodologies that focus primarily on the "how" of implementation, Event Modeling emphasizes the "what" and "why" of business processes, offering a shared language for all stakeholders.

### Key Benefits

- **Improved Collaboration**: Facilitates communication between developers, product managers, UX designers, and business analysts.
- **Clarity**: Provides a clear and visual blueprint of system behavior.
- **Predictability**: Reduces the risk of misaligned requirements and costly rework during development.

## **2. Core Concepts**

### Events

- **Definition**: Immutable facts about what has occurred in the system (e.g., "Order Placed," "Payment Processed").
- **Purpose**: Capture the state change of an entity over time.

### Commands

- **Definition**: User or system intentions to change the state of the system (e.g., "Place Order," "Cancel Subscription").
- **Purpose**: Trigger actions that result in events.

### Views (Read Models)

- **Definition**: Representations of data tailored for specific use cases or user interfaces (e.g., "Order Summary Page").
- **Purpose**: Provide insights and support decision-making by aggregating and presenting data from events.

### Triggers

- **Definition**: External factors or user actions that initiate a sequence of operations.
- **Purpose**: Define the starting points for use cases.

## **3. Building Blocks and Patterns**

Event Modeling is built on four primary building blocks and leverages specific patterns to address common scenarios.

### Building Blocks

1. **Triggers**: Define the external stimuli.
2. **Commands**: Capture intent.
3. **Events**: Record state changes.
4. **Views**: Provide projections for user needs.

### Patterns

1. **Command Pattern**: Isolate business logic that leads to events.
2. **View Pattern**: Structure data retrieval optimized for specific user needs.
3. **Automation Pattern**: Automate repetitive workflows triggered by events.
4. **Translation Pattern**: Convert data between systems or domains seamlessly.

## **4. Application in Traditional Systems**

While Event Modeling is particularly effective for event-driven systems, it can also be applied to traditional systems using relational databases.

### Steps to Apply in Traditional Systems

1. **Identify Key Events**: Map business processes to a sequence of state changes.
2. **Define Commands and Views**: Align commands with user intents and views with business queries.
3. **Integrate Events into the Database**: Use tables to represent event streams.

### Advantages

- Ensures systematic design even with legacy systems.
- Encourages forward-thinking architecture for future scalability.

## **5. Comparison with Event Storming**

Event Modeling and Event Storming are complementary techniques often used in the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) toolkit. However, they serve distinct purposes:

| **Aspect** | **Event Modeling** | **Event Storming** |
| ---------- ||  |
| **Focus**     | Designing the solution space      | Exploring the problem space             |
| **Output**    | A blueprint for implementation    | Shared understanding of domain concepts |
| **Artifacts** | Commands, Events, Views, Triggers | Event timeline, aggregates, policies    |
| **Formality** | Structured                        | Exploratory                             |
