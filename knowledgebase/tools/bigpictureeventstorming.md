# K**Big Picture EventStorming**

## What Is Big Picture EventStorming?

**Big Picture EventStorming** is an immersive, workshop-based method for exploring and modeling an entire business domain by focusing on **domain events**—noteworthy occurrences that change the system’s state. Conceived by **Alberto Brandolini** in the early 2010s and inspired by **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, it aims to:

- Foster **cross-functional collaboration** between business and technical stakeholders.  
- Surface **hidden dependencies**, inefficiencies, and unexplored assumptions.
- Generate **actionable insights** for strategic and operational improvements.

Unlike traditional modeling approaches that often rely on technical diagrams, **Big Picture EventStorming** harnesses free-form exploration, inclusive participation, and visual storytelling to reveal how a domain truly operates.

## Why Use Big Picture EventStorming?

1. **Discovery of Hidden Complexity**  
   Traditional modeling can overlook tacit knowledge buried in organizational silos. By collaboratively identifying domain events, participants expose unseen processes, conflicting interpretations, and systemic constraints that might otherwise remain unnoticed.  
   *Example:* A logistics company uncovered a manual process for tracking returns—previously invisible to decision-makers—during an EventStorming session.

2. **Facilitation of Cross-Functional Collaboration**  
   **Business leaders, domain experts, technical teams, and end-users** all speak the same “event language” in EventStorming. This shared perspective bridges gaps between departments and breaks down communication barriers.  
   *Example:* A retail company used EventStorming to bring marketing and IT teams together, reducing campaign rollout time by 30%.

3. **Acceleration of Learning**  
   What typically takes weeks or months of isolated research is condensed into a **few hours** of dynamic, collaborative discovery. Teams quickly grasp complex systems and can make more informed decisions faster.

4. **Uncovering Strategic Insights**  
   By mapping an entire system visually—from events to pain points—organizations can pinpoint **bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and improvement areas**. This holistic view often sparks innovative solutions or reveals untapped opportunities.

## Key Principles

![Elements of Big Picture EventStorming]()

1. **Domain Event Focus**  
   - **What Are Domain Events?**  
     They are significant, observable state changes in a system (e.g., “Order Created,” “Payment Approved,” “Shipment Dispatched”).  
   - **Why Focus on Events?**  
     Events form a natural, business-friendly language. They expose **causality, dependencies**, and the **sequence** of processes, bridging technical and non-technical conversations.

2. **Inclusivity and Diversity**  
   - **Who Should Participate?**  
     A broad mix of stakeholders—business analysts, developers, product managers, operations, end-users, and potentially customers.  
   - **Why Diversity Matters**  
     Each person brings a unique lens. A domain expert flags critical rules, a developer spots potential constraints, and a user highlights real-world friction.  
   - **Techniques for Engagement**  
     Use **icebreakers**, **group rotations**, and **active facilitation** to ensure every voice is heard, especially in culturally diverse or hierarchical environments.

3. **Free-Form Exploration**  
   - **Purpose of Chaotic Exploration**  
     Participants add sticky notes of events, questions, or challenges without immediate critique. This unstructured approach uncovers **tacit knowledge** and **unspoken assumptions**.  
   - **Benefits of Open Contribution**  
     The lack of rigid rules spurs creativity, revealing details that might never emerge in a more formal setting.  
   - **Handling Overlaps and Redundancies**  
     Duplicates or contradictions often signal **ambiguity** or **misalignment**, paving the way for deeper discussions.

4. **Collaborative Refinement**  
   - **From Chaos to Clarity**  
     After the initial burst of ideas, the facilitator guides the group in **organizing events** into logical timelines and clusters.  
   - **Identifying Patterns and Dependencies**  
     Visualizing the sequence reveals repeated patterns, bottlenecks, and dependencies that can hamper efficiency.  
   - **Resolving Ambiguities**  
     Group discussions during refinement clarify **edge cases** and **exceptions** that were initially overlooked.

5. **Actionable Outcomes**  
   - **Translating Insights into Action**  
     The ultimate goal is producing deliverables—like a prioritized list of improvements or a clarified project scope—that can be acted upon immediately.  
   - **Linking to Strategy**  
     Align recognized challenges and opportunities with overarching business goals for better **executive buy-in**.  
   - **Deliverables and Artifacts**  
     Provide **visual summaries**, documentation of insights, and a definitive list of next steps to sustain momentum post-workshop.

## Steps to Facilitate a Big Picture EventStorming Workshop
