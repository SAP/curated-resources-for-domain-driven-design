# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Concepts: A Comprehensive Overview

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a strategic approach to software development that emphasizes aligning the software model closely with the business domain. Below is a bullet-point list of key DDD concepts, organized into strategic and tactical categories to provide a clear understanding of the framework.

## **Strategic Design Concepts**

- **[Ubiquitous Language](./concepts/strategic-concepts/ubiquitouslanguage.md)**
  - A common, shared language between developers and domain experts.
  - Ensures clear communication and consistency across the model.

- **[Bounded Context](./concepts/strategic-concepts/boundedcontext.md)**
  - Defines a clear boundary within which a specific domain model is applicable.
  - Prevents ambiguity by ensuring terms and concepts have consistent meanings within the context.

- **[Context Mapping](./tools/strategic/contextmapping.md)**
  - Visual representation of how different bounded contexts interact.
  - Identifies integration patterns and relationships between contexts.

- **[Subdomains](./concepts/strategic-concepts/domain.md#core-subdomains)**
  - **[Core Subdomain](./concepts/strategic-concepts/domain.md#core-subdomains):** The primary area that provides competitive advantage and is central to the business.
  - **[Supporting Subdomai](./concepts/strategic-concepts/domain.md#supporting-subdomains):** Assists the core subdomain but is not unique to the business.
  - **[Generic Subdomain](./concepts/strategic-concepts/domain.md#generic-subdomains):** Common functionalities that can often be outsourced or implemented using third-party solutions.

## **Tactical Design Concepts**

- **[Entities](./concepts/tactical-concepts/entities.md)**
  - Objects with a distinct identity that persists over time.
  - Defined by their continuity rather than their attributes.

- **[Value Objects](./concepts/tactical-concepts/valueobjects.md)**
  - Immutable objects defined solely by their attributes.
  - Do not have a unique identity and are interchangeable if their attributes are the same.

- **[Aggregates](./concepts/tactical-concepts/aggregate.md)**
  - Clusters of related entities and value objects treated as a single unit for data changes.
  - Ensures consistency and enforces business rules within the boundary.

- **[Aggregate Root](./concepts/tactical-concepts/aggregate.md#aggregate-root-responsibilities)**
  - The primary entity within an aggregate.
  - Controls access to the aggregate and ensures its invariants are maintained.

- **[Repositories](./concepts/tactical-concepts/repositories.md)**
  - Abstractions for persisting and retrieving aggregates.
  - Provide methods to access aggregates without exposing the underlying data storage details.

- **[Factories](./concepts/tactical-concepts/factories.md)**
  - Responsible for creating complex aggregates.
  - Ensure that all invariants are satisfied during the creation process.

- **[Domain Services](./concepts/tactical-concepts/domain-services.md)**
  - Operations that don't naturally fit within entities or value objects.
  - Encapsulate domain logic that involves multiple aggregates or doesn't belong to any single entity.

- **[Application Services](./concepts/tactical-concepts/application-services.md)**
  - Coordinate tasks and delegate work to domain objects.
  - Handle transactions, security, and other cross-cutting concerns.

- **[Domain Events](./concepts/tactical-concepts/domain-events.md)**
  - Represent significant occurrences within the domain.
  - Facilitate communication between different parts of the system in a decoupled manner.

- **[Modules](./concepts/tactical-concepts/modules.md)**
  - Logical grouping of related concepts within a bounded context.
  - Helps in organizing the domain model for better maintainability.

## Methods & Tools

- **[Big Picture EventStorming](./tools/bigpictureeventstorming.md)**:
  - Holistic Domain Exploration: Immersive workshop method for exploring and modeling an entire business domain by focusing on domain events.
  - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Fosters collaboration between business and technical stakeholders to uncover hidden dependencies and generate actionable insights.

- **[Process and Design Level EventStorming](./tools/eventstorming.md)**:
  - Collaborative Exploration: Uses a workshop format to collaboratively explore and model complex business domains through domain events.
  - Rapid Insight Generation: Facilitates rapid knowledge sharing and identification of domain insights, inefficiencies, and improvement areas.

- **[Context Mapping](./tools/contextmapping.md):**
  - Visualizes Relationships: Helps understand and visualize the relationships and interactions between different bounded contexts and teams.
  - Patterns and Best Practices: Utilizes specific patterns and best practices to manage dependencies and communication flows effectively.

- **[Domain Message Flow Diagrams](./tools/domain-message-flow.md):**
  - Message Flow Visualization: Illustrates the flow of messages (commands, events, queries) between actors, bounded contexts, and external systems.
  - Dependency Identification: Helps identify dependencies, potential bottlenecks, and ensures alignment with business processes.

- **[Event Modeling](./tools/eventmodelling.md):**
  - Focus on Data Evolution: Models how information changes over time through events, commands, views, and triggers.
  - Improved Collaboration: Enhances communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders by providing a clear visual blueprint of system behavior.

## **Design Principles and Patterns**

- **[Encapsulation](./concepts/design-principles/encapsulation.md)**
  - Hides the internal state and requires all interactions to occur through well-defined interfaces.
  - Protects the integrity of the domain model.
- **[Separation of Concerns](./concepts/design-principles/separation-of-concerns.md)**
  - Divides the system into distinct sections, each addressing a specific aspect of the functionality.
  - Enhances maintainability and scalability.
- **[Single Responsibility Principle](./concepts/design-principles/srp.md)**
  - Each module, class, or component should have one reason to change.
  - Promotes focused and manageable codebases.
- **[Command-Query Separation (CQRS)](./concepts/design-principles/cqrs.md)**
  - Distinguishes between operations that modify state (commands) and those that retrieve state (queries).
  - Enhances clarity and predictability in system behavior.
- **[Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters](./concepts/design-principles/hexagonal.md)**
  - Isolates the core domain logic from external systems through defined ports and adapters.
  - Promotes flexibility and ease of testing.
- **[Specification Pattern](./concepts/design-principles/specpattern.md)**
  - Encapsulates business rules that determine whether an object satisfies certain criteria.
  - Enables reusable and combinable business logic.

## **Architectural Patterns and Practices**

- **[Microservices Architecture](./concepts/architectual-concepts/msa.md)**
  - Implements each bounded context as an independent microservice.
  - Enhances scalability and allows for independent deployment.

- **[Modular Monolith](./concepts/architectual-concepts/modular-monolith.md)**
  - Organizes bounded contexts into distinct modules within a single application.
  - Balances separation of concerns with simpler deployment compared to microservices.

- **[Event-Driven Architecture](./concepts/architectual-concepts/eda.md)**
  - Utilizes asynchronous events for communication between bounded contexts.
  - Promotes loose coupling and scalability.

- **[CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)](./concepts/architectual-concepts/cqrs.md)**

  - Separates read and write operations into different models.
  - Optimizes performance and scalability by handling commands and queries independently.

- **[Event Sourcing](./concepts/architectual-concepts/event-sourcing.md)**
  - Stores the state of a domain model as a sequence of [domain events](./concepts/tactical-concepts/domain-events.md).
  - Enables rebuilding of the state by replaying events and supports audit trails.

- **[Architecture Modernization](./concepts/architectual-concepts/architecture-modernization.md)**
  - Transform legacy systems into modern, adaptable architectures aligned with business strategy and customer needs.
  - Focus on incremental improvements, stakeholder buy-in, and fostering collaboration for continuous innovation and efficiency.

## **Additional Concepts**

- **[Anti-Patterns](./concepts/additional-concepts/antipatterns.md)**
  - Practices that go against DDD principles, such as Anemic Domain Model or God Objects.
  - Should be avoided to maintain a robust and maintainable domain model.

- **[Collaborative Modeling](./concepts/additional-concepts/collaborativemodelling.md)**
  - Engaging domain experts and developers in the modeling process.
  - Ensures the model accurately reflects business realities.

## **Best Practices**

- **[Align Bounded Contexts with Business Boundaries](./concepts/best-practises/aligmentbusiness.md):** Ensure that technical boundaries reflect real-world business divisions and responsibilities.

- **[Keep Bounded Contexts Small and Focused](./concepts/best-practises/bcsmallfocused.md):** Smaller contexts are easier to manage, understand, and evolve.

- **[Maintain Clear Interfaces](./concepts/best-practises/interfaces.md):** Define explicit interfaces for interactions between bounded contexts to facilitate communication and integration.
