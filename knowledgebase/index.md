# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Concepts: A Comprehensive Overview

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a strategic approach to software development that emphasizes aligning the software model closely with the business domain. Below is a bullet-point list of key DDD concepts, organized into strategic and tactical categories to provide a clear understanding of the framework.

## **Strategic Design Concepts**

- **[Ubiquitous Language](./concepts/strategic-concepts/ubiquitouslanguage.md)**

  - A common, shared language between developers and domain experts.
  - Ensures clear communication and consistency across the model.

- **[Bounded Context](./concepts/strategic-concepts/boundedcontext.md)**

  - Defines a clear boundary within which a specific domain model is applicable.
  - Prevents ambiguity by ensuring terms and concepts have consistent meanings within the context.

- **[Context Mapping](./tools/strategic/contextmapping.md)**

  - Visual representation of how different bounded contexts interact.
  - Identifies integration patterns and relationships between contexts.

- **[Subdomains](./concepts/strategic-concepts/domain.md#core-subdomains)**

  - **[Core Subdomain](./concepts/strategic-concepts/domain.md#core-subdomains):** The primary area that provides competitive advantage and is central to the business.
  - **[Supporting Subdomai](./concepts/strategic-concepts/domain.md#supporting-subdomains):** Assists the core subdomain but is not unique to the business.
  - **[Generic Subdomain](./concepts/strategic-concepts/domain.md#generic-subdomains):** Common functionalities that can often be outsourced or implemented using third-party solutions.

## **Tactical Design Concepts**

- **[Entities](./concepts/tactical-concepts/entities.md)**

  - Objects with a distinct identity that persists over time.
  - Defined by their continuity rather than their attributes.

- **[Value Objects](./concepts/tactical-concepts/valueobjects.md)**

  - Immutable objects defined solely by their attributes.
  - Do not have a unique identity and are interchangeable if their attributes are the same.

- **[Aggregates](./concepts/tactical-concepts/aggregate.md)**

  - Clusters of related entities and value objects treated as a single unit for data changes.
  - Ensures consistency and enforces business rules within the boundary.

- **[Aggregate Root](./concepts/tactical-concepts/aggregate.md#aggregate-root-responsibilities)**

  - The primary entity within an aggregate.
  - Controls access to the aggregate and ensures its invariants are maintained.

- **[Repositories](./concepts/tactical-concepts/repositories.md)**

  - Abstractions for persisting and retrieving aggregates.
  - Provide methods to access aggregates without exposing the underlying data storage details.

- **[Factories](./concepts/tactical-concepts/factories.md)**

  - Responsible for creating complex aggregates.
  - Ensure that all invariants are satisfied during the creation process.

- **Domain Services**

  - Operations that don't naturally fit within entities or value objects.
  - Encapsulate domain logic that involves multiple aggregates or doesn't belong to any single entity.

- **[Application Services](./concepts/tactical-concepts/application-services.md)**

  - Coordinate tasks and delegate work to domain objects.
  - Handle transactions, security, and other cross-cutting concerns.

- **Domain Events**

  - Represent significant occurrences within the domain.
  - Facilitate communication between different parts of the system in a decoupled manner.

- **Modules**

  - Logical grouping of related concepts within a bounded context.
  - Helps in organizing the domain model for better maintainability.

- **Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)**

  - Acts as a barrier between different bounded contexts.
  - Translates and mediates interactions to prevent one context's model from corrupting another's.

- **Shared Kernel**

  - A small, shared subset of the domain model used by multiple bounded contexts.
  - Requires strict coordination to manage changes and maintain consistency.

- **Open Host Service**

  - Defines a public interface for a bounded context to interact with other contexts.
  - Facilitates controlled and standardized communication.

- **Published Language**
  - A language or protocol used by multiple bounded contexts to communicate.
  - Ensures clarity and consistency in inter-context communication.

## **Design Principles and Patterns**

- **Encapsulation**

  - Hides the internal state and requires all interactions to occur through well-defined interfaces.
  - Protects the integrity of the domain model.

- **Separation of Concerns**

  - Divides the system into distinct sections, each addressing a specific aspect of the functionality.
  - Enhances maintainability and scalability.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**

  - Each module, class, or component should have one reason to change.
  - Promotes focused and manageable codebases.

- **Command-Query Separation (CQS)**

  - Distinguishes between operations that modify state (commands) and those that retrieve state (queries).
  - Enhances clarity and predictability in system behavior.

- **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**

  - Isolates the core domain logic from external systems through defined ports and adapters.
  - Promotes flexibility and ease of testing.

- **Specification Pattern**
  - Encapsulates business rules that determine whether an object satisfies certain criteria.
  - Enables reusable and combinable business logic.

## **Architectural Patterns and Practices**

- **Microservices Architecture**

  - Implements each bounded context as an independent microservice.
  - Enhances scalability and allows for independent deployment.

- **Modular Monolith**

  - Organizes bounded contexts into distinct modules within a single application.
  - Balances separation of concerns with simpler deployment compared to microservices.

- **Event-Driven Architecture**

  - Utilizes asynchronous events for communication between bounded contexts.
  - Promotes loose coupling and scalability.

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**

  - Separates read and write operations into different models.
  - Optimizes performance and scalability by handling commands and queries independently.

- **Event Sourcing**
  - Stores the state of a domain model as a sequence of domain events.
  - Enables rebuilding of the state by replaying events and supports audit trails.

## **Integration Patterns**

- **Customer/Supplier**

  - One bounded context (Supplier) provides services or data to another (Customer).
  - The Customer depends on the Supplier's model.

- **Conformist**

  - The dependent context conforms to the model of the context it relies on without influencing it.
  - Often used when one context cannot change due to external constraints.

- **Separate Ways**

  - Bounded contexts operate independently with no direct interaction.
  - Suitable when contexts have minimal or no overlapping concerns.

- **Shared Kernel**

  - A small, shared subset of the domain model used by multiple bounded contexts.
  - Requires strict coordination to manage changes.

- **Open Host Service**
  - Provides a public interface for a bounded context to interact with others.
  - Facilitates controlled and standardized communication.

## **Additional Concepts**

- **Anti-Patterns**

  - Practices that go against DDD principles, such as Anemic Domain Model or God Objects.
  - Should be avoided to maintain a robust and maintainable domain model.

- **Bounded Context Diagrams**

  - Visual representations of bounded contexts and their interactions.
  - Aid in understanding and communicating the system's architecture.

- **Collaborative Modeling**

  - Engaging domain experts and developers in the modeling process.
  - Ensures the model accurately reflects business realities.

- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**
  - Practices that support the continuous evolution and deployment of bounded contexts.
  - Enhances agility and responsiveness to changing business needs.

## **Best Practices**

- **Align Bounded Contexts with Business Boundaries**

  - Ensure that technical boundaries reflect real-world business divisions and responsibilities.

- **Keep Bounded Contexts Small and Focused**

  - Smaller contexts are easier to manage, understand, and evolve.

- **Maintain Clear Interfaces**

  - Define explicit interfaces for interactions between bounded contexts to facilitate communication and integration.

- **Avoid Overlapping Responsibilities**

  - Ensure each bounded context has distinct responsibilities to prevent duplication and conflicts.

- **Encourage Independent Evolution**

  - Design bounded contexts to evolve independently, allowing teams to iterate and improve without being hindered by other contexts.

- **Invest in Robust Documentation**

  - Maintain comprehensive documentation for each bounded context, including its purpose, models, interfaces, and integration points.

- **Foster Cross-Functional Teams**
  - Encourage collaboration between developers, domain experts, and stakeholders within each bounded context to enhance model accuracy and relevance.
